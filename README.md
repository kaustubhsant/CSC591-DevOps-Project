##Build Section:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are using Jenkin server hosted on EC2 instance, as our continous integration server pipelined with 'Git' a version control system to build the target project.

- We have created integration end-points both at the git repository end by adding webhook for the hosted Jenkin service running on the EC2 instance as well as the at the Jenkin server end where it is listening for the events published by the git repository per associated branch.
- For our python application we are using 'pip' as our package manager to build the given project , triggered through the shell execution. We are using workspace clean plugin in Jenkins to clean up all the environment before the build is executed.
- In Jenkins, successful execution is determined by the status of last successful command executed in the build procedure. In case of the failures in the build, email notification will be sent as part of post-build execution procedure.
- In Jenkins we have configured different jobs associated with the different branches from the git repository.
- Jenkins allows tracking as well as the displaying of past builds through the web interface.
